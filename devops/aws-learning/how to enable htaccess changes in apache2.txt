.htaccess Not Working - How to Troubleshoot and Fix
.htaccess needs to be enabled with AllowOverride
This is the first thing that should be verified. If the AllowOverride directive is set to None then this will disable all .htaccess files. In order to verify this, you must open the Apache configuration file (typically either called httpd.conf or apache.conf) and check that the AllowOverride directive is set to AllowOverride All. If you needed to make changes to your Apache config, remember to save the file and restart Apache.

	vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
	<Directory /var/www/>
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
		AllowOverride All
		Require all granted
	</Directory>
