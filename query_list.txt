Apart from a good server with great ram & cpu you also need to do some database level
optimisation.Use a good mysql engine like innodb which doesn't lock the table while writes happening & also crash-safe.

Optimize basic mysql variables like:-

innodb_buffer_pool_size
thread_cache_size
max_connections
query_cahce
innodb_log_trx_commit

Use proper technique for setting these values otherwise performance may be degrade.

If your load is too much on the server then you can also use some load balancing techniques like mysql proxy ,mysql clustering

You can setup replication & divide the load accordingly.
