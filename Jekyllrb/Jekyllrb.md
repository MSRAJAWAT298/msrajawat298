## [Jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Jekyllrb, often referred to simply as Jekyll, is a static site generator written in Ruby. 
- It's a popular tool used by developers to create websites or blogs without the need for a backend or a database. 
- Jekyll takes text files, typically written in Markdown, along with HTML, CSS, and Liquid templates, and generates a static website. 
- This means that the resulting site consists only of HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, images, and other static assets. 
- There's no need for server-side processing, which makes Jekyll websites fast, secure, and easy to host on various platforms like GitHub Pages.
- Jekyll is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use, making it a favorite among developers for creating blogs, personal websites, documentation sites, and more. 
- It's also highly customizable, allowing users to create themes, plugins, and layouts tailored to their specific needs.
- [Why Chose Jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com/showcase/)
    There are several reasons why someone might choose Jekyllrb for their website or blog:

    1. **Simplicity**: Jekyll offers a simple and straightforward approach to building websites. It's easy to set up and use, especially for developers who are familiar with Markdown, HTML, and CSS.

    2. **Speed**: Since Jekyll generates static HTML files, the resulting websites are fast to load. There's no need for server-side processing, which can significantly improve page load times, especially for larger websites or those with high traffic.

    3. **Security**: With no server-side processing or database interactions, Jekyll websites are inherently more secure than dynamic websites. There are fewer attack vectors, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

    4. **Portability**: Jekyll websites are essentially a collection of files that can be easily moved or hosted on various platforms. This portability makes it convenient for developers to deploy their sites wherever they prefer, including services like GitHub Pages.

    5. **Version Control**: Jekyll integrates well with version control systems like Git. This allows developers to track changes to their website's content and code, collaborate with others, and easily roll back to previous versions if needed.

    6. **Customization**: Jekyll is highly customizable, allowing developers to create custom themes, layouts, and plugins to fit their specific requirements. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of projects, from simple blogs to complex websites.

    7. **Community and Ecosystem**: Jekyll has a vibrant community of developers who contribute themes, plugins, and resources. This active ecosystem provides plenty of resources and support for those using Jekyll for their projects.

    Overall, the choice of Jekyll depends on the specific needs and preferences of the developer or team. However, its simplicity, speed, security, and flexibility make it a compelling option for many web development projects.
