Most of the during development of Rest API :
https://chat.openai.com/share/cb3d11c6-5605-4101-8fda-9047327736e6

Developer not use all http methods they only used ```GET &  POST methods```.

During the development they are created function like ```getUsers, CreateUsers, DeleteUsers, updateUsers``` etc.

while if you are using http methods then no need to define like this: you can use create only one function with the name ```Users``` and use ```http.method```

Also they are not following the status code as per the recommendations.
Like if user is created they return the http status code 200 while it is recommend to use 201.
and similar type of issue I have notice that 80% of developer doing this type of mistakes.

If you are passing the custom headers as response should be added X your headers name such as X-headerName : something
