EMAIL SUBJECT: Database Programmer Position Application
Dear Mr. Broadus:
This email is in regards to my interest in applying for the Database Programmer position you have recently
posted through CareerShift. While browsing the General Synthetics webpage I came across your data system
optimization page and found it quite informative. The techniques and services provided by General Synthetics
range across a wide and impressive spectrum. Aside from the variety of services provided, I was also
impressed by the multitude of published projects which demonstrates how General Synthetics is a leader in
database management and strives to be the best. With my skills and knowledge base I would be able to help
facilitate this process and with my ability to adapt to different situations I would be able to prepare for a
variety of projects.
During my studies at Champlain College, I have had the opportunity to hone my skills with tools C++, C#,
SQL, Visual Basic 6.0, Java, VB.NET, JavaScript, VBScript, HTML, and Microsoft XNA. Inside the
classroom I have committed myself to academic excellence. Outside of the classroom, I helped set up the Kids
in Technology and Science Project at our school, which introduced elementary and middle school students to
digital animation and personal computers. My three years as a member of the Software Engineering Club here
on campus has helped connect students of different backgrounds into one team that functions as an inclusive
and supportive group.
I am currently available for an interview scheduled at the convenience of General Synthetics. I have attached
my resume detailing my academic knowledge and my technical skills. Thank you, your time and consideration
is greatly appreciated.
I look forward to talking with you soon,
Curtis Jackson
